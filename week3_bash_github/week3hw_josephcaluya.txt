To navigate to my Desktop from /Users/ using an absolute path:
cd /Users/josephcaluya/Desktop
Using a relative path:
cd josephcaluya/Desktop

To copy /Desktop/Example Folder/ with multiple documents inside to /Documents/:
scp -r /Users/josephcaluya/Desktop/Example Folder /Users/josephcaluya/Documents

/Documents/ by using pwd to print the current directory, then using cd ../ ... as many
times as needed until you get to Documents.
